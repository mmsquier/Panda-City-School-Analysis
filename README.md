# Panda City School Analysis

Introduction 

Assignment asks for the analyzis of the district-wide standardized test results. Two .csv are provided to access every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The Pandas code aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Analyzis 

Overall, schools with higher budgets, didn't have better test results. Schools with higher spending per student actually under performed compared to schools with smaller budgets. Smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%). As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
